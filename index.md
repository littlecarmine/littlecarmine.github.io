Junior at [Brown U.](https://www.brown.edu/) studying Computer Science.
High-level hipster by day, low-level lizard by night.
I love making different Programming Languages talk to each other. Compilation & Transpilation, Shell pipelines, and programming language design are all right up my alley.

This site is built with a Jekyll theme I published myself, [consolo](https://github.com/Forthoney/consolo).
