## Name
My name written in Korean (the original way) is 정성헌.
"Seong-Heon" is my first name and "Jung" is my last name.

### Pronunciation
My name is pronounced
- __Seong__ as in sing-sang-(_sung_)
- __Heon__ as in (_hon_)ey
- __Jung__ as in (_seong_) but replace the s with a j
All three sounds in my name actually have the same vowel sound, but my first name uses "eo" to represent this vowel and my last name uses "u".
This is due to complicated but interesting bureaucratic reasons. The short answer is the romanization guidelines changed between when my grandparents decided to romanize their names and when I romanized my name. So, my last name (which I take from my father & paternal grandfather) follows the old standards and my first name follows the [new standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Romanization_of_Korean).
